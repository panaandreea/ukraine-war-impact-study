# The War in Ukraine and Its Economic, Social, and Cultural Impact

This repository contains an academic study analyzing the economic, social,
and cultural impact of the war in Ukraine on the European space.

The study does not focus on the military developments of the conflict itself,
but rather on its macroeconomic and socio-cultural consequences for the
European Union. The analysis addresses economic imbalances, the energy crisis,
changes in living standards, as well as broader social and cultural
transformations generated by the ongoing geopolitical context.

A case study is employed to illustrate the economic impact of the conflict,
focusing on the natural gas market, a strategic sector with significant
spillover effects on European economies, societies, and public policies.
